##Graph Isomorphism

This problem implements a [Splay Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree). The program itself is built off of code that was provided for a Binary Search Tree. With that said, I am not posting the module the my splay tree is built off of, as it is not mine. The program itself should still give a pretty good idea of what is going on though!

I also included the test file I highlight how I actually did some of the testing on the class.

Sorry for the inconvience.
