##Stuffed Boxes

We all have that dreadful friend that gives you a giant box for your birthday. When you go to open it you find that it is full of a smaller box, and before you know it, you are in boxception. Finally, the last box contains a $5.00 giftcard to Subway.

These boxes all have dimensions, which we represent as three integers in a row. L x W X H. The Input to this problem is first a number of boxes that will be used, then the dimensions of those boxes. The output of this program is the maximum number of the given boxes that can fit inside each other.

To run the program simply execute the following, which is set up to compile and run against a provided test file:

`make test`
