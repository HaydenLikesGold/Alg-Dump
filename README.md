#Alg-Dump

This is a collection of solutions to famous algorithm based problems that I have solved through academic courses. With that said, this is all academic code, so please keep that in mind when looking through it.

##Problems Covered
The problems covered include:
  * [Graph Isomorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism)

##Roadmap
Each folder contains the solution to a different problem, solved in either Python or Java. Each individual folder contains a README with specific details.
