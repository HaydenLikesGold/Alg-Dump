##Graph Isomorphism

This problem is based on determining if a graph is [isomorphic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) or not. The input is given in the form of an adjacency matrix, with a first value being the size of each matrix, followed by the two matrices for comparison.

1 0 0
0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0

The program itself uses python3, you can use the makefile to run the test files provided. Simply run the command `make test` to run through the provided test files. It is assumed the input is properly formatted.
