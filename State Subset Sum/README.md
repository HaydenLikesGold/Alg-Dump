##State Subset Sum

This problem is an extension of the [Subset Sum Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem). The problem statement is to see if you can split the US states and find a subset that adds up to 47%. Pretty easy, also, turns out it is possible.

To run the program simply execute the following commands in order:

`javac StateSubsetSum.java`
`java StateSubsetSum`
