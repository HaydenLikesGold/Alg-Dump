Algorithms Homework 5

	I decided to work on both of these problems on my own, as I had previously encountered them when preparing for the ACM Programming Competition. Nested boxes was one that Nate Jenson, Sam Seuk, and I had thought through, at your recommendation. Spectrum was in last years competition, if I recall correctly, so it was used as study material on the days leading up to the competition. Since I was already aware of the problems, I thought it would be best if I worked alone to add some challenges. One thing I over estimated was how much work it would take to get the graphs and searching set up and ensure that I was using the right ones. I actually set up Nested Boxes with the wrong structure at first which spent me sometime to get to the bottom of. The standard input of both was also based on my teams preperations for ACM.

	One of the biggest issues I ran into was my use of Arrays rather than ArrayLists. In Nested, I really ran into this issue as you can see with the function appendToArray(). I spent time copying and moving over an array that needed one additional value, this took up much more space and time than using an ArrayList and simply adding to it. This is something I caught when doing a quick code debriefing before starting Spectrum, that is why you can see Spectrum uses an ArrayList to track the vertices. 
	Another thing I did was in Nested, since I knew the maximum number of inputs, I simply used it throughout the code to act as a ceiling to the values. 

	Overall, I felt this project went well. I had a general idea of the alogirthms needed to solve the problem, but this was of benefit and also worked against me. While it was helpful in figuring out a plan that worked well, it often lead me down the wrong path when I though I knew what the proper solution was. For each problem, I had to take a step back, write up somework on a whiteboard and go from there to get a working solution. Also, as soon as I started refactoring, things became much easier to work with and debug.
